# weather-dashboard-codyp
## Description

My motivation for this Project was to create an app that used a server Side API. I wanted something that myself and friends/family could benefit from so I created a weather dashboard. Although weather dashboards are quite common I wanted to do a case study of how a weather app could be built with knowledge I have gained thus far. For this app I used the Open Weather API for my calls. I also used the built in date function in JavaScrpit to get the dates. I also used local stoarge to save the previous searched cities.
